An analysis of the sales of a company with insights and recommendations

**Insights**

The sales rep with the most sales is David, while Bob has the highest number of returning customers. The product that had the most sales is clothing. Furniture gives the most profit, while food has the least profit and the least sales. The most popular sales channel is retail. The northern region had the most sales. Clothing had the most discounts and the highest sales. But the discount does not influence the sales because the food had a high discount but low sales.

**Recommendations**
1. Make more furniture and clothing available for sale since they give the most profit.
2. Concentrate more on selling in the north since they have the most sales.
3. Give fewer discounts on food since it doesn't influence the sales.
4. Bob and David should be given more incentives since they have the most returning customers and the most sales, respectively.
